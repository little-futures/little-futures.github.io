title: Why I'm building a new consulting practice called Yes! and...
subtitle: New beginnings, 18 months in 
---

Hello world!

I've been working as an independent consultant for the past 18 months and today I'm launching a new identity for my work called <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span>

Being self employed is a lot like going on a road trip. It's exciting, sure, but also brings with it a sense of being untethered, of being a long way from home. Always looking to the horizon and the next rest stop, never stopping to build routines. So <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> is an acknowledgement that being on the road is now home (metaphorically of course, IRL Brooklyn is still my home although I a coffeeshop nomad).

## Why the name?

The name <span class="brandsmall">Yes! and...</span> is a nod to the improvisational nature of consulting and balancing thinking on your feet while avoiding BS. But it's also a reflection of my default positive attitude towards clients and projects. I approach clients like partners not paychecks.

## Great! So, what is the work that you do?

Good question! As an independent consultant the kind of work I've done has been wide and varied. For example:

I've worked with media companies like the **New York Times** and **Complex Media** on the mechanics of content - SEO strategy, audience development and .

I've worked with startups like **Olapic** as CMO and marketing advisor helping to guide marketing activity and add leadership to fast-moving environments.

In concrete terms, engagements typically start out in one of three ways:

- An on-site workshop where we get the interesting people in the room and work through the strategy
- Project based work to define & build the marketing engine, this is typically embedded within your organization
- Recruiting work, helping to understand who you're trying to hire and then finding them

Read a little more about the mechanics of the work I do over on my <a href="/work">work page</a>.

## On Connected Networks & Consulting

The lifeblood of a consulting business is the referral network that provides a gravity to attract interesting work and I've been inspired by those around me building networks of support for independents.

## So What's Next?

I'm going to be writing a little more frequently on the inner workings of running an independent consulting practice and also sharing some of my thinking around content, audience development and marketing.
